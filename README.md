# Image Recognition Integration System (IRIS)

IRIS is an open-source framework designed to help developers build AI-powered image search applications with ease.

## The Vision Behind IRIS

The Image Recognition Integration System (IRIS) was created to simplify the development of domain-specific image search applications by providing a structured and modular framework.

The need for such a system arose from challenges faced in various fields, such as healthcare, education, and research, where efficient image retrieval and AI-powered search functionalities are crucial. Current solutions often require deep expertise in machine learning and infrastructure setup, making it difficult for many developers to integrate image recognition and search functionalities into their applications.

To address these challenges, IRIS was designed as an easy-to-use, scalable framework that allows developers to integrate pre-trained machine learning models and efficiently search through image datasets. Whether a developer wants to build a healthcare diagnostic tool, an educational image repository, or a research-oriented image retrieval system, IRIS provides the necessary components to streamline development.

One of the initial proof-of-concept applications is a system for identifying proprietary surgical screws, demonstrating the framework’s capabilities in a real-world medical use case. While not intended for immediate production deployment, this prototype showcases how IRIS can be adapted to specific industry needs and highlights areas for further improvement.
