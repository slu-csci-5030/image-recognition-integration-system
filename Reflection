## What did you observe about the process?

Mob programming process encouraged teamwork and feedback. It was very helpful as a group of people 
are working on the same problem for issues like Docker file errors and YAML indentation. Collaborative 
effort made it easier to learn from others and solve problems faster.

## What did you contribute?

I helped in debugging the docker-compose file and fixed syntax errors in the Docker files for both RERUM and 
Tiny Node. I have also resolved the issue with the Docker Desktop as it was not running properly on windows.
I have ensured that the folder structure and paths were correct.

## Did you have ideas that did not get included? If so, why?

I have suggested .env file for configuration management, which would help code separation from environment 
specific values. We decided to meet the requirement running without .env file to keep it simpler.

##Where you familiar with any of the tools before we used them? If so, how could we have used them better? If not,
what would have helped you use the tools more easily?

No, I donâ€™t have much familiarity with Docker but had basic knowledge of Docker. This session helped me in 
understanding and debugging the issues.

## How can we encourage communication within the group while doing mob programming?

To keep everyone involved, we set a timer for each member so that everyone would get a chance to give their input.
And also setting short-term goals for each session could help maintain focus and balance contributions.

## Where there things that worked well for the group? How can we amplify those things?

Real-time debugging and feedback were very effective. We stayed productive and learned by solving problems together 
and it also helped with knowledge sharing.
